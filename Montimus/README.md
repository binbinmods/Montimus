# Lord Montshek

This mod adds Lord Montshek and Archon Mont as replacements for Lord Hanshek and Archon Nihr.

These enemies are intended to be _slightly_ harder than Lord Hanshek and Archon Nihr, but are likely currently unbalanced, as such any Balancing Suggestions are extremely welcome!

In order to fight either Montshek and Mont, all you have to do is make it to the end of act 4 and choose the "What is that?!" option.

If you have any suggestions for things you would like to see, let me know! Likewise, if you come across any issues, pleae ping me on the [Across the Obelisk Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/across-the-obelisk-679706811108163701). :)

This has not been tested in multiplayer yet, so let me know if there are any issues! Note: there are likely to be a good number of them.
